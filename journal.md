# 8/25/25

- started with an idea, have no idea how to get there

- decided by going through the page on how to learn verilog, and watched things like the video, and after that I moved on to HDLbits for the rest of the hour, and I feel quite confused
- One of the things at the end of this hour that really confused me were vectors, especially the second problem related to them which introduces things like implicit wires and vector directions in endianness
- I'm also not used to it being possible to have a higher number for values towards the left (little endian)
